I have created the server for the Food factory App based on my understanding of the scenarios. Hope it meets your requirement.
 
I have used a single express application to achive what you need with different api's for different scenarios,
and I have use my localhost mongodb as my DB whic is mentioned in the .env file

All the api are available in the routes folder and the db instance file is available in the util folder
